I implement three classes for this.The train queue must be visually shown and let passenger waiting in the waiting room to be added to trainQueue without the need of reentering the data but adding from waiting room passenger list to queue.
Train queue must visualized with 42 slots and passenger name should be displayed against seat if s/he has arrived to board the train otherwise display empty.passenger detail should be taken as input and passenger should be deleted.Store trainQueue data into a plain text file.Load data back from the file into the trainQueue.Run the simulation and produce report
